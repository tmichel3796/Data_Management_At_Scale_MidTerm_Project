Thank you for viewing my Project!


This is a great example of how I code with data management practices in mind.
For details on the assignment the teacher gave us you can look in the original_class_instructions folder.


What I would change if I did this project again.
 
  - In part 1 and 2 there is a ton of repeated code.
    - If done again, I would remove the hard coded actions, and instead define functions to handle repeated tasks.
    - It is because of the repeated code that this particular project was not given a spot on my website.

The project was broken out into 4 parts.

  - In Part 1 I show how I would systematically approach downloading a  large number of files.

  - In part 2 I go into detail on how I explore data.
 
  - In part 3 I show How I would combine many spreadsheets of data together.

  - In part 4 tnhoeuisnthosenuzvith
